Accessing the file pages. This should make them resident
  File page access for0 ; the first byte is: 'Z'
  File page access for1 ; the first byte is: 'X'
  File page access for2 ; the first byte is: 'A'
Modifying swap pages in the order 1 3 and then FB page 0 to make them dirty. Making them equal to X Y Z
  Succeeded modifying swap pages 1, 3 and file page 0
Force the clock evictions. Access pages in order 0 to 4 for swap pages
  Swap page 0 has value: 'A'
  Swap page 1 has value: 'X'
  Swap page 2 has value: 'C'
  Swap page 3 has value: 'Y'
  Swap page 4 has value: 'E'
